# optoML_Task
Implementation of Single Stage Pipeline Register using a ready/handshake protocol
🚀 Features Standard Handshake: Uses valid/ready protocol.
Backpressure Support: Automatically stalls upstream logic when downstream is not ready.
Single-Cycle Throughput: Combinational ready path allows data to pass through in one clock cycle.
Parameterized: Configurable data width (WIDTH) for reusable design.Fully Synchronous: 
Optimized for FPGA and ASIC synthesis.
